                <p>Luminal Website Builder is part of a personal project Iâ€™ve been working on for a number of years. It allows users with little or no coding experience to build their personal or small business website with an easy-to-use interface. Similar to Wix and Squarespace website builders; users can create responsive and multi-purpose websites by dragging and dropping elements, editing text, changing colors, and changing options of individual elements without writing or editing code.</p>
                <h2 className="heading primary-color">Goal</h2>
                <p>Whether or not I could design and build a website builder on my own was one of the many questions I asked myself when I started this project. The initial goal was to create a customizable HTML template with great design, browser support, and customization options. The idea of being able to customize the template without editing or writing code was tempting. I decided to bundle a website builder with the template that would make customization faster and easier; and would also serve as a personal challenge to test and improve my design and development skills.</p>
                <h2 className="heading primary-color">Colors Feature</h2>
                <p>The colors feature gives the user control over individual colors across their website. Most builders provide a combination of colors that change the overall theme of the website in its entirety. I wanted users to easily change colors individually and create any combination of available colors with a simple interface. I took some time to contemplate which route to take when implementing the colors feature. I came up with two solutions that would give varying levels of control to the user, and varying levels of complexity and time needed to implement.</p>

                <p>Jwiz Graphics Corrections is a web app I develped at Jwiz Marketing Solutions that drastically reduced the time needed to proofread and correct mistakes for client graphics. I created an editor that uses JavaScript canvas and allows the proofreader to highlight certain areas over the image that need correction. When an area is highlighted; a note is created and used to type the correction that the graphics designer can later read and correct without dealing with paper and hand-written notes. It has been used to proofread and correct the flyers, coupons, and banners of over 700 clients.</p>
