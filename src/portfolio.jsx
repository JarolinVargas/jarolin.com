                <p>Luminal Website Builder is part of a personal project Iâ€™ve been working on for a number of years. It allows users with little or no coding experience to build their personal or small business website with an easy-to-use interface. Similar to Wix and Squarespace website builders; users can create responsive and multi-purpose websites by dragging and dropping elements, editing text, changing colors, and changing options of individual elements without writing or editing code.</p>
                <h3 className="heading primary-color">Luminal HTML Template</h3>
                <p>Luminal Template is part of the Luminal personal project. It's a highly customizable, multi-purpose, responsive HTML5 template with excellent browser compatibility; and can be easily customized without writing or editing code using the Luminal Website Builder. I focused on using a component-based system when designing and building the template to let users place and reuse components in many ways without hassle.</p>

                <p>Jwiz Graphics Corrections is a web app I develped at Jwiz Marketing Solutions that drastically reduced the time needed to proofread and correct mistakes for client graphics. I created an editor that uses JavaScript canvas and allows the proofreader to highlight certain areas over the image that need correction. When an area is highlighted; a note is created and used to type the correction that the graphics designer can later read and correct without dealing with paper and hand-written notes. It has been used to proofread and correct the flyers, coupons, and banners of over 700 clients.</p>
