            <p>Jwiz Graphics Corrections is a web app I develped at Jwiz Marketing Solutions that drastically reduced the time needed to proofread and correct mistakes for client graphics. I created an editor that uses JavaScript canvas and allows the proofreader to highlight certain areas over the image that need correction. When an area is highlighted; a note is created and used to type the correction that the graphics designer can later read and correct without dealing with paper and hand-written notes. It has been used to proofread and correct the flyers, coupons, and banners of over 700 clients.</p>
